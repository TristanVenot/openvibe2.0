The applied coefficient matrix must be specified as a box parameter. The filter processes each sample independently of the past samples.

The spatial filter generates a number of output channels from another number of input
channels, each output channel being a linear combination of the input channels.
For example, lets say *ICj* is the *j</em>th input channel, <em>OCk* is the
*k</em>th output channel, and <em>Sjk* is the coefficient for the <em>j</em>th input
channel and *k</em>th output channel in the <em>Spatial filter* matrix.

Then the output channels are computed this way :
*OCk* <b>=</b> Sum on *j</em> ( <em>Sjk* \* *ICj* )

Inputs
------

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Input Name", "Stream Type"

   "Input Signal", "Signal"

Input Signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This input contains the input channels to mix.

Outputs
-------

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Output Name", "Stream Type"

   "Output Signal", "Signal"

Output Signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This output contains the generated channels, mixed from the input channels.

Spatial Filter Coefficients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setting contains a flat view of the spatial filter matrix. The coefficient orders is as follows :
all the coefficients for the first output followed by all the coefficients for the second output and so on..

Number of Output Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of output channels to generate

Number of Input Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of input channels to compute from

Filter matrix file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filter matrix. You can alternatively provide the filter coefficients as an ASCII file.

Examples
--------

Let's consider the following example :

- Input channels list: C3;C4;FC3;FC4;C5;C1;C2;C6;CP3;CP4 (10 channels) 

- Spatial filter coefficients: 4 0 -1 0 -1 -1 0 0 -1 0 0 4 0 -1 0 0 -1 -1 0 -1 (20 values)
- Number of output channels: 2
- Number of input channels: 10


The output channels becomes :

.. code::

   OC1 = 4 \* C3 + 0 \* C4 + (-1) \* FC3 + 0 \* FC4 + (-1) \* C5 + (-1) \* C1 + 0 \* C2 + 0 \* C6 + (-1) \* CP3 + 0 \* CP4
   = 4 \* C3 - FC3 - C5 - C1 - CP3
   
   OC2 = 0 \* C3 + 4 \* C4 + 0 \* FC3 + (-1) \* FC4 + 0 \* C5 + 0 \* C1 + (-1) \* C2 + (-1) \* C6 + 0 \* CP3 + (-1) \* CP4
   = 4 \* C4 - FC4 - C2 - C6 - CP4

This is basically a Surface Laplacian around C4 and C5.

Miscellaneous

For large filters, it is somewhat faster to provide the matrix in an ASCII file than having the coefficients in scenario.xml directly. 
If a file is used, the filter size is read from the file and the other parameters of the box are ignored.

To provide the filter matrix as a file, the format is the same as is used for storing electrode localizations. E.g. for 3x3 identity matrix, the file would be


.. code::

   [ ;  \*       [ "row1" "row2" "row3" ] ;  \*       [ "col1" "col2" "col3" ] ;  \* ]
   [ ;  \* [ 1 0 0 ] ;  \* ]
   [ ;  \* [ 0 1 0 ] ;  \* ]
   [ ;  \* [ 0 0 1 ] ;  \* ]

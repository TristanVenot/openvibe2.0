The *Continuous Oscilloscope* displays temporal numerical data in the form of curves, all the channels being distributed vertically, each one with its own horizontal axis.
Channel are given a color, overlaps are rendered additively.
The display is done **continuously** , meaning that once the end of the horizontal scale is reached, it goes back to the origin.

The *Continuous Oscilloscope* box shares common concepts and settings with the other boxes in the **Mensia Advanced Visualization Toolset**.
Additional information are available in the dedicated documentation pages:

- :ref:`Doc_Mensia_AdvViz_Concepts`
- :ref:`Doc_Mensia_AdvViz_Configuration`



Inputs
------

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Input Name", "Stream Type"

   "Matrix", "Signal"
   "Markers", "Stimulations"

Matrix
~~~~~~

The first input can be a streamed matrix or any derived stream (Signal, Spectrum, Feature Vector).
Please set the input type according to the actual stream type connected.

Markers
~~~~~~~

The second input expect stimulations. They will be displayed as **red vertical lines**.

Channel Localisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The channel localisation file containing the cartesian coordinates of the electrodes to be displayed.
A default configuration file is provided, and its path stored in the configuration token ``${AdvancedViz_ChannelLocalisation}``.

Temporal Coherence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select *Time Locked* for a continuous data stream, and specify the *time scale* below.
Select *Independent* for a discontinuous data stream, and specify the *matrix count* below.

Time Scale
~~~~~~~~~~

The time scale in seconds, before the displays goes back to the origin.

Matrix Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of input matrices to receive before the displays goes back to the origin.

Positive Data Only ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this checkbox is ticked, the vertical scale is shifted so that 0 is at the bottom. Only positive values will be displayed.

Gain
~~~~

Gain (floating-point scalar factor) to apply to the input values before display.

Caption
~~~~~~~

Label to be displayed on top of the visualization window.

Translucency
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setting expect a value between 0 and 1, from transparent to opaque color rendering (nb: this value is the alpha component of the color).

Color
~~~~~

Color gradient to use. This setting can be set manually using the color gradient editor.
Several presets exist in form of configuration tokens ``${AdvancedViz_ColorGradient_X}``, where X can be:

- ``Matlab`` or ``Matlab_Discrete``
- ``Icon`` or ``Icon_Discrete``
- ``Elan`` or ``Elan_Discrete``
- ``Fire`` or ``Fire_Discrete``
- ``IceAndFire`` or ``IceAndFire_Discrete``


The default values ``AdvancedViz_DefaultColorGradient`` or ``AdvancedViz_DefaultColorGradient_Discrete`` are equal to </t>Matlab</tt> and ``Matlab_Discrete``.

An example of topography rendering using these color gradients can be found :ref:`Doc_Mensia_AdvViz_Configuration` "here".

Visualization Settings
----------------------

At runtime, all the advanced visualization shared settings are exposed, as described in :ref:`Doc_Mensia_AdvViz_Configuration_RuntimeToolbar`.

.. _Doc_BoxAlgorithm_ContinuousOscilloscope_Examples:

Examples
--------

In the following example, we filter the input signal in the 8-15 Hz frequency range and simply display it.

You can find a commented scenario in the provided sample set, the scenario file name is \textit{ContinuousOscilloscope.mxs}.
